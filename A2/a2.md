<u><b>Problem 3:</b></u>
The cipher implemented in problem 2 is more secure than a Caesar Cipher
because instead of just simply needing the key, you also need to know the sum of all previous shifts. This means that if you get a single letter wrong along the way, all letters after that mistake will also be wrong. Essentially it is one more thing you need to know in order to break the cipher.

<u><b>Problem 5:</b></u>
The cipher implemented in problem 4 is more secure than a traditional Caesar cipher as well as the cipher implemented in problem 3 because it uses a word/string of alphabetical characters as the key, as well as implementing the sum of all previous shifts into the encryption. This means that instead of having to guess a single letter or number as a key, you need to know the entire word. If any letter of the key is out of place, incorrect or a character too long/short the resulting decryption will fail.
